        Linear Regresssion

 Steps in implementation of linear regression model in googles stocks datasets
 1. First, get the datasets. 
 2. Before implementing the algorithm, filter out the unwanted features that have no role to play in predicting the label
 3. Fill the NaN values, we cannot work with empty values in machine learning
 4. Scale the featues
 5. From your dataset, separate train and test dataset randomly
 6. Implement the Linear Regression algorithm in train data 
 7. Find out the accuracy percentages
